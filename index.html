        <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
        <p>Unequal distribution of healthcare, education and economic opportunity that fosters systemic injustices is one issue that the United States has today that hurt marginalized communities. Corruption in government institutions and private-sector entities skews democracy by facilitating lobbying, violations of campaign finance laws, regulatory capture and bribery. Yet another issue is graft and other unethical practices by police departments, prisons and the criminal justice system that, among other problems, disproportionately incarcerate people of color and lead to police brutality. Journalists who uncover these ills and bring criminal and civil action against the individuals or entities responsible help us to live in a better and fairer world. Upton Sinclair’s muckraking novel "The Jungle" mined the shortcomings of rampant venality. Sinclair used evocative detail to describe how "getting rich" and "turning a profit" brings out the worst in people: breaking rules and guidelines, finding cheap and inexperienced foreign immigrant laborers, valuing dollars much more the value of a person. <mark>Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle'' reveals a philosophy of American society at the turn of the 19th Century where exploitation is more important than humanism. Jurgis and his family are targets of corporate corruption and greed.

        <h2>Exploitation</h2>

        <p>Sinclair gave insights into the challenging conditions through Jurgis's eyes. Sinclair illustrates how companies prioritize their profits over the well-being of their employees, forcing them to work in hazardous working conditions for minimal pay. Since these workers were working in harsh working environments and basically had no safety precautions, this often led to worker accidents and injuries as proved by this quote: “An engine and a loaded car dashed round one of the innumerable right-angle branches and struck him upon the shoulder, hurling him against the concrete'' (Sinclair 187), and because Packingtown was full of people who were desperately looking for a job, it didn't take long for the businesses to find a replacement. Since a job was a huge necessity in surviving through the harsh winters, people were willing to do anything to get/keep their job, even if that meant harming themselves. The businesses basically had everyone who worked for them, wrapped around their finger and could get them to do anything they wanted because they knew the workers needed the job to survive. </p>

    <section id="corruption">
        <h2>Corruption and Greed</h2>

        </p> Sinclair highlights the damaging effects of the uncheck authority within the capitalist system. Sinclair portrays that moral integrity is sacrificed for power. Sinclair brings light to the situation of "higher ups” using their status for their own personal gain, and for getting away with crimes that a normal person could not get away with. For example, Phil Connor rapes Jurgis's wife Ona, and gets no repercussions. Connor used his status to get his way with Ona because if she would have told anyone about it then Phil Connor would have gotten Ona's family evicted and would have been forced to live on the streets during the harsh winter as explained in this quote: “He told me - he would have us turned off. He told me he would - we would lose all of our places.” (Sinclair 125). Greed has impacted every decision in the book. It has made people do horrible things for money. This is especially present when it comes to the elections. Greed is everywhere, hurting the poor the most, and because of their greed they are due to suffer greatly.

    <section id="capitalism">
        <h2>Capitalism</h2>
        <p>Sinclair's interpretation of Capitalism is like a double edged sword. It shows the brutal reality of an unrestrained capitalist society. In the story it shows problems with Capitalism and how it leads to widespread suffering for the working class. It shows Capitalism portrayed as a corrupt ad\nd greedy system. This reveals how businesses take advantage of employees by paying them a low-wage while making them work dangerous jobs. Someone who was affected by this corrupt system was Jurgis, it shows his perspective and what he had to endure during the 19th century.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Throughout Upton Sinclair's book "The Jungle" it showed many examples of greed ruling over kindness and how these corrupt businesses would threaten the workers well-being for a little bit of extra cash rather than properly take care of them. Throughout the book, Jurgis and his family were a prime victim of the greedy companies and corrupt people. This shows how this was a world that cared more about making money than human dignity. Businesses were mainly focused on how they could exploit their workers rather than treating them with basic respect. Jurgis and his family experience showed how these businesses were infected with corporate corruption and greed.</p>

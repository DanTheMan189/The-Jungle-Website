        <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
        <p>One issue that the US has today is the unequal distribution of healthcare, education and economic opportunity that fosters systemic injustices and hurts marginalized communities. Another is corruption in government institutions and private-sector entities that skews democracy by facilitating lobbying, violations of campaign finance laws, regulatory capture and bribery. And yet another is graft and other unethical practices by police departments, prisons and the criminal justice system that, among other problems, disproportionately incarcerated people of color and lead to police brutality. Journalists who uncover these ills and bring criminal and civil action against the individuals or entities responsible help us to live in a better and fairer world. Now we talk about Upton Sinclair’s muckraking novel "The Jungle" that mined the shortcomings of rampant venality. Sinclair used evocative detail to describe how "getting rich" and "turning a profit" brings out the worst in people: break rules and guidelines, find cheap and inexperienced foreign immigrant laborers, value dollars much more than you’ve ever valued the person, the man or the woman who hands over this shiny, shiny object. <mark>Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle'' reveals a philosophy of American society at the turn of the 19th Century where exploitation is more important than humanism. Jurgis and his family are targets of corporate corruption and greed.

        <h2>Exploitation</h2>

        <p>Sinclair gave insights into the challenging conditions through Jurgis's eyes. Sinclair illustrates how companies prioritize their profits over the wellbeing of their employees, forcing them to work in hazardous working conditions for minimal pay. Since these workers were working in harsh working environments and had basically no safety precautions, this often led to worker accidents and injuries, and because Packingtown was full of people who were desperately looking for a job so that they and their family could survive, it didn't take long for the businesses to find a replacement. Because a job was a huge necessity in surviving through the harsh winters, people were willing to do anything to get/keep their job, even if that meant harm to themselves. Basically the businesses had everyone, who worked for them, wrapped around their finger and could get them to do anything they wanted because they know the workers need the job to survive. </p>

    <section id="corruption">
        <h2>Corruption and Greed</h2>
        <p>Sinclair highlights the the damaging effects of the uncheck authority within the capitalist system. Sinclair potrays that moral integrety is sacrificed for power. Sinclair brings light to the situation of "higher ups” using their status for their own personal gain, and for getting away with crimes that a normal person could not get away with. For example, Phil Connor rapes Jurgis's wife Ona, and gets no repercussions. He used his status to get his way with Ona because if Ona told anyone about it then Phil Connor would have gotten Ona's family evicted and would have been forced to live on the streets in the harsh winter. Greed has impacted every decision in the book. It has made people do horrible things for money. This is especially present when it comes to the elections. Greed is everywhere and hurting the poor the most. Because of their greed they are due to suffer greatly.

    <section id="capitalism">
        <h2>Capitalism</h2>
        <p>Sinclair's interpretation of Capitalism is like a double edged sword. It shows the brutal reality of an unrestrained capitalist society. In the story it shows problems with Capitalism and how it leads to widespread suffering for the working class. It shows Capitalism portrayed as a corrupt ad\nd greedy system. This reveals how businesses take advantage of employees by paying them a low-wage while making them work dangerous jobs. Someone who was affected by this corrupt system was Jurgis, it shows his perspective and what he had to endure during the 19th century.</p>

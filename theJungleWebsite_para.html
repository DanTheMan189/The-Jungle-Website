        <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
        <p>One issue that the US has today is the unequal distribution of healthcare, education and economic opportunity that fosters systemic injustices and hurts marginalized communities. Another is corruption in government institutions and private-sector entities that skews democracy by facilitating lobbying, violations of campaign finance laws, regulatory capture and bribery. And yet another is graft and other unethical practices by police departments, prisons and the criminal justice system that, among other problems, disproportionately incarcerated people of color and lead to police brutality. Journalists who uncover these ills and bring criminal and civil action against the individuals or entities responsible help us to live in a better and fairer world. Now we talk about Upton Sinclair’s muckraking novel "The Jungle" that mined the shortcomings of rampant venality. Sinclair used evocative detail to describe how "getting rich" and "turning a profit" brings out the worst in people: break rules and guidelines, find cheap and inexperienced foreign immigrant laborers, value dollars much more than you’ve ever valued the person, the man or the woman who hands over this shiny, shiny object. <mark>Sinclair spent part of The Jungle detailing how bribes, fraud and cheating were shared between conspiring industry bosses – and this is why he raged so enthusiastically at a system without even the most basic level of moral integrity. Sinclair’s novel reveals the dark attraction of capitalism, where making money is more important than caring about . Sinclair’s book reminds us that people want better rules to protect workers, or at least that workers wanting to be empowered – not exploited – and that society should be built so that workers are safe and healthy and given their due by others and huge corporations.
